# AHK-to-js

**AHK-to-js** is a transpiler from AutoHotkey (AHK) to JavaScript (JS) that puts it all in a full HTML file. It aims to simulate AHK inside a browser on almost any device.

**Note:**
- This project is specifically for AutoHotKey V1.
- AHK-to-js is still in development. 
- Documentation coming soon. 

## Usage

To use AHK-to-js:

1. Ensure you have AutoHotKey V1 installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
2. Add your AHK code in `AHKcode.ahk`.
3. Run `AHK to js.ahk`.
4. You'll get `temp.html` as output.
5. Open for edit `temp.html` coppy the full file do `Ctrl+A` then `Ctrl+C`
6. Open `PrettierFormatter.html`
7. Format the code and then put it it back in `temp.html`
8. Open the `temp.html`

For coding style, you should use Allman style since functions won't be recognized here is an example:

Do this:

```ahk
nameOfFunc(a, b)
{
return a + b
}
```
Not this:

```ahk
nameOfFunc(a, b) {
return a + b
}
```

Also, `return` must be in lowercase.

So far, AHK-to-js supports:

- Functions
- If, else, else if
- Random
- Sleep
- Msgbox
- SetTimer
- gosub/goto they literally do the same thing
- lables here a lable:
```ahk
; We will go the label
gosub, Label1

; We put return in lowercase to stop the code executing after otherwise; otherwise, it will go to the label twice.
return
Label1:
MsgBox, we are in Label1

; We MUST put a Return with a capital letter R at the beginning of the word 'Return' otherwise it will not work. This is not the same case in real AutoHotkey, but here we need to do that.
Return
```
- InputBox can only pass 2 or 3 parameters here is an example:

```ahk
InputBox, OutputVar, We will only see this title in AutoHotKey, And this will be seen as the only thing in js and this will be the text in ahk

; also you can do it like this
InputBox, OutputVar, And this will be seen as the only thing in js and in ahk this will be the title and the text of the InputBox 
; please don't add more parameters or commas ","
```

- IfMsgBox after an `IfMsgBox` at the end, add `} ; end of ifmsgbox`

Example:
```ahk
MsgBox, 36, Title Here, Yes or No
IfMsgBox, Yes
{
	MsgBox, You clicked on Yes	
} ; end of ifmsgbox

```
or
```ahk
MsgBox, 36, Title Here, Yes or No
IfMsgBox, Yes
{
	MsgBox, You clicked on Yes	
}
else
{
	MsgBox, You clicked on No	
} ; end of ifmsgbox
```

- OutputDebug (equivalent to `console.log` in JS)
- Loop
- Loop, Parse
- Increment (e.g., `var++`)
- Simple dynamically function calls. Example: `func%num%()` cant do `%num%func()` also not `func%num%name()` you can only have one `%var%` at the end.
- Assignment operators (`:=`, `.=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`)
- Comments dont use comments in the same line as the code (Note: Comments might be translated in some cases)

Some features haven't been fully tested but should work include:

- Abs
- ACos
- ASin
- ATan
- Ceil
- Cos
- Exp
- Floor
- Ln
- Log
- Round
- Sin
- Sqrt
- Tan
- Chr
- InStr
- RegExMatch
- RegExReplace
- StrLen
- StrSplit
- Format
- Ord
- SubStr
- Trim
- StrReplace
- Mod
- Asc

Built-in Variables
- A_Index
- A_LoopField
- A_ScreenWidth
- A_ScreenHeight
- A_GuiControl comming soon ðŸ‘€
- A_TimeIdle
- A_TickCount
- A_NowUTC
- A_Now
- A_YYYY
- A_MM
- A_DD
- A_MMMM
- A_MMM
- A_DDDD
- A_DDD
- A_Hour
- A_Min
- A_Sec
- A_Space
- A_Tab
- A_IsTranspiled in js it will be set to 1 in ahk its will be blank so you can do somting like:
```ahk
if (A_IsTranspiled = 1)
{
; do something if its transpiled
}
else
{
; do something if its not transpiled
}
```

## Platform Compatibility
