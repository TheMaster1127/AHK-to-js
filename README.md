"This is a new project called AHK-to-js."
This project is still in development.
This is a transpiler from AHK to JS with HTML in a full HTML file.
Documentation coming soon. Just one thing: if you want to try it now, after an IfMsgBox at the end, add } ; end of IfMsgBox.
Example:
```ahk
IfMsgBox, Yes
{
	
}
else
{
	
} ; end of ifmsgbox

```
or
```ahk
IfMsgBox, Yes
{
	
} ; end of ifmsgbox

```
